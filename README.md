# tinyCode_FunWithArrays
Learning about arrays in JavaScript

I wanted direct experience working with array methods. One evening I had the idea of creating a game in which a player must unscramble letters to win. Using a handful of common array methods I set about creating the game. 

The player begins by clicking Start. A random word is selected from an array bank of words. The word is then split, randomized, and reconstituted in scrambled form.
Using built in array methods the user shifts the letters from one box to another until one of the boxes contains the original unscrambled word
During play the code is checking to see if the player has won the round.
To start a new round the player clicks Start. If the player would like to start over with the current word, a reset button is provided.
